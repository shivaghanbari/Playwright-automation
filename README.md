# Test Automation Project with Playwright and Allure
This project demonstrates test automation using Python, Playwright, and Allure for reporting. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to organize and maintain test scenarios.

Feel free to contribute.

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **tests/**: Contains test files, each representing a test scenario (e.g., `test_login.py`, `test_register.py`).

- **models/**: Contains model files that define page-specific elements and actions using Playwright (e.g., `login.py`, `navigate.py`).
  
- **reportsByAllure/**: Stores the generated Allure reports.
  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies for the project.
